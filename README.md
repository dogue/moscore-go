# MOScore (Go)

This is a reimplementation of my [prior work](https://github.com/dogue/moscore) on a library for creating emulators for 6502-based systems.

This version exists because writing it in Rust was wearing me down. I'll flesh out this readme more later. In the meantime, I'm trying to keep the code fairly simple so if you're familiar with Go it should be reasonably easy to skim and get the gist of what's happening.
